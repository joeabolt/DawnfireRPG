# Fighter
Fighters are warriors, standing steadfast in the way of harm and battering down their foes. They are raging berserkers, meditative monks, faithful paladins, gleeful gladiators and stoic rangers.

__Skills__: Fighters receive 3 skill ranks each level which they may assign as they see fit, and 2 skill ranks which must go into combat skills.

__Proficiencies__: Fighters are proficient with martial weapons, armor, and shields, but not magical weapons or robes.

## Class Abilities
The following are class abilities of the fighter.

### Combat Training
Every Fighter is, to simplify it vastly, someone who fights - usually quite well, too. As a [Fast Action], a Fighter may focus on the fight and call their training to mind, granting themselves either a +1 bonus to AC, a +1 bonus to their next attack roll, or a +2 bonus to their next damage roll. They may make a 5-foot step as part of this action. Regardless of bonus chosen, it expires at the start of their next turn.

### First Totem
At 2nd level, archaic though it may be, a Fighter forms a bond with a totem. They may find it in the heraldry of their family line, as a mystical spirit tutor, or simply a compelling idea. They permanently choose one of the totems, listed at the end of this section, and gain its first ability.

They gain another ability from their totem at 5th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, with their final totem ability at 20th level.

### Focus
When a Fighter reaches 4th level, they learn to focus all their combat prowess into a devastating martial state. This could be blinding rage, cool detachment, or even meditation. The Fighter picks an ability score related to their particular emotion. That ability score becomes their Focus Bonus.

As an [Instant Action], the Fighter may become focused. The drain on their attention costs them 5 [HP Reduction] each [Round] or fraction thereof they are focused. They may end their focus as an [Instant Action]. It ends automatically if they fall unconscious.

While focused, the Fighter adds their Focus Bonus to all attack rolls.

### Toughness
At 7th level, a Fighter learns to handle overwhelming punishments with comparable ease. They gain [Resistance] to [Physical] damage equal to one-half their level. While below 0 hit points, they cannot lose more than 3 hit points per [Round].

### Swift and Sure
At 10th level, a Fighter's footwork improves, letting them move across the battlefield with more confidence than their opponents. When making a 5-foot step, they may move 10 feet instead of 5. They may move 5 feet as part of making an attack. When targeted by an attack, the Fighter may use a [Reaction] to move 5 feet, possibly moving out of range of the attack.

### Shrug it Off
Upon reaching 13th level, a Fighter can shrug off most debilitating conditions. When affected by a harmful condition, the duration decreases by 1 of whatever increment is most appropriate (usually days, hours, or [Rounds]), to a minimum of 0.

### That Hideous Strength
When a Fighter reaches 16th level, their strength becomes indomitable. Their Focus Bonus increases by 3. When making a Strength check or contest, the Fighter may choose the result of the d20 roll instead of rolling (they may choose to forego this ability and roll anyway).

### Unbreakable
At 18th level, a Fighter becomes borderline indestructible. While below 0 hit points, they remain conscious and cannot lose more than 1 hit point per [Round], though they are [Staggered] and [Energy Drained] 4. They are [Immune] to [Precision], [Poison], and [Fear] effects.

# Totems

## Bear
The Bear is a totem of power. It is contemplative, steady, and devastating. Very few dare to fight against it in power. Its rage is uncompromising. For Focus, you may choose Strength or Constitution.

### Overswing
At 2nd level, your attacks swing wide - obvious, predictable, and horrifyingly powerful. When you make a Power Attack, add your Strength + your level as bonus damage. From 4th level on, use your Focus Bonus instead of your Strength.

## Crane
The Crane is a totem of peace. It prefers to evade, block, or redirect enemy attacks. Its inner peace is infectious, and it often ends fights without striking. For Focus, you may choose Dexterity or Wisdom.

### Parry
At 2nd level, you learn to effortlessly push aside incoming attacks. As long as you are aware of an incoming attack, you may spend a [Reaction] to parry it - this adds your Strength + your initiative to your AC against that attack. From 4th level on, use your Focus Bonus instead of your Strength.

## Dragon
The Dragon is a twinned spirit of aggression and protection. Its scales repel magic, while its flames annihilate all who stand against it. For Focus, you may choose Strength or Charisma.

### Coat of Dragon Scales
At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with White and Grey robes. If you are not wearing robes, add one-half your armor bonus as a bonus to SR. If you are not wearing armor, add one-half your robes bonus as a bonus to AC.

## Foundation
The Foundation represents stability, defense, and control. It is a master of the battlefield, harrowing foes, holding ground, and driving enemies toward the Fighter. For Focus, you may choose Constitution or Intelligence.

### Push Back
At 2nd level, you can stomp the ground and call up vicious stone spikes all around you. These deal 1d8 + your Strength damage to adjacent enemies, and inflict [Knocked Back] 5 feet. This ability takes a [Standard Action]. [Flying] enemies are [Immune]. From 4th level on, use your Focus Bonus instead of your Strength.

## Firmament
The Firmament is a totem of nothingness. It is lack of life and lack of magic. Its clutches are inescapable, and it easily reaches out to any foe. For Focus, you may choose Dexterity or Charisma.

### Empty Fist
At 2nd level, your hands are charged with [Negative] energy. Your unarmed strikes deal  one-half your level, minimum 1, as bonus [Negative] energy damage. They deal 1d8 + Strength physical damage, with critical 20 x3. From 4th level on, use your Focus Bonus instead of your Strength. As long as you do not use any manufactured weapons, your initiative is +2 higher.

## Serpent
The Serpent represent swiftness, precision, and mercilessness. Its blows are quick and crippling, following up on each other. Serpent fighters often fight unarmed. For Focus, you may choose Strength or Wisdom.

### Serpent Fang
At 2nd level, you learn to use your fists, elbows, knees, and feet as deadly weapons. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + Strength base damage, with critical 18-20 x4. If you score a critical hit, your foe is also [Staggered] for 1 [Round].

## Wolf
The Wolf it a totem of teamwork. It runs fastest of all, fights alongside its allies, and works together to bring down even the mightiest of foes. For Focus, you may choose Strength or Constitution.

### Loping Stride
At 2nd level, your long stride grants you supernatural quickness. Increase your movement speed by 10 feet, and by another 5 feet each time you gain another totem power. When you use the Charge combat maneuver, you do not have to move in a straight line.
