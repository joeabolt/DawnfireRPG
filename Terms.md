# Terms & Definitions
### Actions
* __AP__: Action Point. At the beginning of your turn each [Round], you lose any AP you still have and get 3 new AP. These limit how many actions you can take on one turn.
* __[Bonus AP]__: An additional Action Point that you have for a limited time. You may only be able to use it on limited actions. Whatever ability granted you the [Bonus AP] will give you more details.
* __[Fast Action]__: This is an action that costs 1 AP.
* __[Immediate Action]__: This is an action that can be taken at any time, even when it is not your turn. It costs 0 AP.
* __[Instant Action]__: This is an action that costs 0 AP.
* __[Reaction]__: Special type of action. A [Reaction] is an [Immediate Action] that can only be taken off your turn. Even if you have multiple abilities that can be used as [Reactions], you can only use one [Reaction] per turn.
* __[Slow Action]__: This is an action that costs 3 AP.
* __[Standard Action]__: This is an action that costs 2 AP.

### Beneficial Conditions
* __[Concealment]__: You are hard to see. You have a 20% [Miss Chance].
* __[Full Concealment]__: You can only be seen as a vague outline - creatures targeting you know where you are within about 3 feet. You have a 50% [Miss Chance].
* __[Ethereal]__: You are primarily in the magical world, not the real world. You are [Invisible] to creatures in the real world. Nonmagical weapons deal no damage to you, and magical weapons and spells deal half damage. [Force] effects work normally against you. You move through any material as though it were not there, except lead, which you cannot move. Your spells and any equipment enchanted so you can grip it work normally.
* __[Invisibility]__: You and your equipment cannot be seen. You have a 50% [Miss Chance] and a +3 bonus to AC, SR, and attack rolls. Your "equipment" counts as anything you can easily physically move when you do - your backpack and its contents are [Invisible], and a sword you pick up becomes [Invisible]. If you try to drag a table, it does not become [Invisible]. Devices that emit light or darkness still do. You do not cast a shadow.
* __[Miss Chance]__: A chance that an attack or targeted spell misses you, aside from any other defenses. When targeted by an attack or spell while you have a miss chance, roll d%. If the result is strictly less than your [Miss Chance], the attack or spell automatically misses. 

### Definition
* __Creature__: A creature is something capable of making decisions and taking actions - immobile gargoyles and golems both count, but nonsentient trees or inanimate objects usually do not. Spell effects are never creatures.

### Harmful Conditions
* __[Bleeding]__: You are taking damage over time. At the beginning of your turn each [Round], take the [Bleeding] damage again. This can usually be stopped with a DC 20 Heal check.
* __[Blinded]__: You cannot see (or use your primary sense). All other creatures gain the benefits of [Invisibility] against you, your movement speed is halved, and you take a -8 penalty to initiative.
* __[Burning]__: Take damage as [Bleeding]. Can usually be ended by drenching you in water or smothering the fire / necrotic bacteria / other.
* __[Deafened]__: You cannot hear (or use your secondary sense). You take a -2 penalty to AC and SR, and a -4 penalty to initiative.
* __[Energy Drained]__: Your vitality, attentiveness, and prowess have been sapped away. You take a -1 penalty to all d20 rolls, AC, and SR. The source of this penalty will describe how long it lasts.
* __[Frightened]__: You are severely afraid. You take a penalty on all d20 rolls, usually -3. You must either confront or flee the source of your fear. This is always a [Fear] condition.
* __[Grappled]__: 
* __[Knocked Back]__: A great force has knocked you away. [Knocked Back] pushes you a certain distance directly away from the source. If you strike another creature or an obstacle, you and the obstacle take 1d6 damage for every 5 feet of movement you had remaining, and you fall [Prone]. If the obstacle was a creature, they also fall [Prone].
* __[Prone]__: You are lying on the ground. You increase your AC and SR by +2 against ranged attacks, but decrease them by -4 against melee attacks. Your movement speed drops to 5 feet. As a [Fast Action] you can stand up, removing this condition.
* __[Revealed]__: Your position is made supernaturally obvious to other creatures. You gain no benefits from [Concealment], [Full Concealment], or [Invisibility], even against a [Blinded] creature.
* __[Shaken]__: You are afraid. You take a penalty on all d20 rolls, usually -1. This is always a [Fear] condition.
* __[Sickened]__: 
* __[Staggered]__: Something has left you unable to act effectively. If it is not your turn, you start your next turn with 1 fewer AP than normal. If it is your turn, you lose 1 AP immediately. If this would put you below 0 AP, you can take no more actions until your next turn.

### Movement Modes
* __[Fly]__: 
* __[Burrow]__: 
* __[Swim]__: 
* __[Climb]__: You are a deft climber, and can scale inclined or vertical surfaces and overhangs without making Athletics checks. You cannot climb perfectly smooth surfaces, or reasonably smooth overhangs. Having a [Climb] speed grants a +8 bonus on Athletics checks to climb.
* __[Teleport]__: This is a modifier applied to other movement. The movement is instantaneous and does not traverse the intervening space. 

### Resistances
* __[Immortal]__: Your health cannot decrease, by any means. You also gain [Immunity] to [Death] effects.
* __[Immune]__: You cannot be affected by a category of effects. These automatically fail against you, including their normal side effects on a failure. If you have [Immunity] to a type of damage, you never take damage of that type. 
* __[Resist]__: You take less damage from a type of damage, or are resistant to a category of effect. If a type of damage, whenever you take damage of that type, reduce the damage by your [Resistance] to a minimum of zero. If you are resistant to a category of effect add your [Resistance] bonus to any static defenses, checks, or contests against that type of effect.
* __[Vulnerable]__: You take more damage from a type of damage, or have difficulty resisting a category of effect. This works exactly as [Resistance], except that it increases damage taken or decreases defenses, as appropriate.

### Senses
* __[Blindsense]__: A generic term for a secondary sense that is acute enough to partially replace your primary sense. While relying on this sense, you treat all targets as [Fully Concealed]. You are [Immune] to [Deafened] as long as you can use this sense or your primary sense.
* __[Blindsight]__: A generic term for a secondary sense that is as precise as your primary sense. While relying on this sense, you have no penalties. You are [Immune] to [Blinded] as long as you can use this sense or your primary sense.
* __[Deathsense]__: The ability to detect nearby undead, dead, and dying creatures. Depending on the source of this ability, it may function as [Blindsense] or [Blindsight]. It works through most barriers, but is blocked by 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of most metals, or a thin sheet of lead. [Deathsense] can easily detect undead creatures. Dead creatures are [Concealed], and are about as difficult to notice as a brightly colored bird in a tree. Living creatures below 0 hit points are [Fully Concealed], and are about as difficult to notice as a rabbit in a garden.
* __[Lifesense]__: The ability to detect the presence of nearby lifeforms. Depending on the source of this ability, it may function as [Blindsense] or [Blindsight]. It works through most barriers, but is blocked by 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of most metals, or a thin sheet of lead. [Lifesense] can only detect living creatures, including non-sentient plants and fungi.
* __[Mindsense]__: The ability to detect the presence of nearby minds. Depending on the source of this ability, it may function as [Blindsense] or [Blindsight]. It works through most barriers, but is blocked by 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of most metals, or a thin sheet of lead. [Mindsense] can only detect creatures with an Intelligence score of 0 or greater.

### Time
* __[Round]__: One unit of combat, in which each actor takes a single turn in initiative order. A [Round] is approximately 6 seconds of in-game time.
* __[Encounter]__: The period of time beginning with when a character encounters a significant obstacle and ending when they overcome the obstacle. Usually, an [Encounter] is a combat, starting when either party becomes aware of the other and ending when one party has fled or been defeated.

### Types of Damage
* __[Acid]__: Damage from corrosive substances. Deals one-half damage to inanimate objects and [Ethereal] creatures.
* __[Cold]__: Damage from lack of heat. Deals one-half damage to inanimate objects and [Ethereal] creatures.
* __[Electricity]__: Damage from high-voltage high-current electrical shocks. Deals one-half damage to inanimate objects and [Ethereal] creatures. Defies your limited conceptions of 'physics' in a world with magic.
* __[Fire]__: Damage from excessive heat. Deals one-half damage to inanimate objects and [Ethereal] creatures.
* __[Force]__: Damage from pressures generated by magical forces. Deals full damage to inanimate objects and [Ethereal] creatures. Defies your limited conceptions of 'physics' in a world with magic.
* __[HP Reduction]__: Damage to your potential for life. [HP Reduction] temporarily decreases your maximum hit points, as well as dealing ordinary, untyped damage. Typically, [HP Reduction] is self-inflicted and removed after 8 hours of rest. When [HP Reduction] is healed, you also heal that many hit points. Another way to think of it is that [HP Reduction] changes your hit point total, but your damage taken remains fixed.
* __[Physical]__: Damage from kinetic energy. Deals full damage to inanimate objects, but deals no damage to [Ethereal] creatures.
* __[Positive]__: Primal life force that heals the living and harms undead. Deals no damage to inanimate objects and one-half damage to [Ethereal] creatures.
* __[Negative]__: Primal death energy that harms the living and heals undead. Deals no damage to inanimate objects and one-half damage to [Ethereal] creatures.

### Types of Effects
* __[Binding]__: An effect that restricts a creature's movement.
* __[Death]__: An effect that attempts to kill a living creature outright, or destory an undead creature. [Death] effects do not lower a creature's statistics or health, though many do so if their primary effect does not take hold.
* __[Fear]__: An effect that relies on a creature's ability to feel fear. Almost always [Mind-affecting] - exceptions are always magical in nature.
* __[Mind-affecting]__: An effect that affects a creature's mind. Creatures with 0 Intelligence (such as some undead or vermin) or 0 Charisma (such as some constructs or summoned creatures without agency) are [Immune] to [Mind-affecting] effects.
* __[Poison]__: An effect based on substances that inhibit your bodily processes.
* __[Precision]__: An effect, usually an attack, that requires great precision to be effective. All bonus damage on a critical hit is [Precision] damage.
