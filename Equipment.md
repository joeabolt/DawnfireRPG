# Equipment
Critically important to every adventurer is their equipment. Hence, this section.

## Carrying Capacity and Inventory
You have 3 + your Strength inventory slots. If your Constitution is 5 or more, you get one more slot. If your Intelligence is 5 or more, you get one more slot (from balancing weight more effectively).

One inventory slot is an intentionally ambiguous unit - an unwieldy item is just as difficult to transport as a heavy one. For most items, you can use these rules to figure out how much space it takes. Otherwise, consult your GM and use your best guess.
* __Weapons__ usually take 1 inventory slot. That is, a roughly stick-shaped object longer than two feet.
    * Small weapons and wands can be paired. Two daggers are 1 inventory slot, as are two wands.
* __Robes__ take 1 inventory slot if you do not have armor; if you have armor, they take none.
* __Light and medium armors and shields__ take 1 inventory slot.
* __Heavy armor__ takes 2 inventory slots.
* Items the size of your fist or smaller do not need to be tracked - all together they take 1 inventory slot. If you have more than 10, the GM is within their right to make you rummage through your pockets looking for something. Abusing this rule results in your objects weighing more.
* Coin-sized or smaller items take 1 inventory slot all together, but do not count against the "small item clutter limit".
* A non-struggling creature one size category smaller than you takes 2 inventory slots.
* Large, unwieldy items such as dragon heads or mid-sized chests take 2 inventory slots.
* If you cannot pick it up but you can push it, it takes up 6 inventory slots. Most wagons fall in this category.

## Encumbrance
If you have not exceeded your inventory slots, you are unencumbered.

If you exceed your inventory slots by 1 or 2, you are encumbered. Your movement speed is halved, as are all your results on physical or combat skill checks. You have a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, to AC, and to SR.

If you exceed your inventory slots by 3 or more, you are grounded. You can only move 5 feet per [Round], automatically fail physical or combat skill checks, have a -12 penalty to attacks rolls, AC, and SR, and take 1d6 [HP Reduction] per [Round] as the weight slowly crushes you. Your muscles are going to cramp something fierce, m'dude.

## Martial Weapons
A weapon is a tool or device designed to inflict physical harm on another creature. These can take a wide variety of forms. For a quick start, use one of the pre-made weapons below.

However, if your adventurer wants to wield something a little different, the following table and modifiers can be used to design new weapons. For an even more in depth guide for making mid- to high-tier weapons, see the smithing guide which allows for varying materials, alloying, forging techniques, and everything else an analysis paralytic could desire.

First, select a weapon size and damage type:

|Size|Type|Base Damage|Crit Thresh|Crit Mult|Range|# Weapon Modifiers|
|----|----|-----------|-----------|---------|-----|------------------|
|Less than 18 inches|Bludgeoning|1d6 |20|3|  5 ft.|1|
|(Short - 1 hand)   |Slashing   |1d6 |19|2|  5 ft.|1|
|                   |Piercing   |1d4 |18|4|  5 ft.|1|
|                   |Ranged     |1d6 |19|3| 30 ft.|1|
|18 inches to 3 feet|Bludgeoning|1d8 |20|3|  5 ft.|2|
|(Medium - 1 hand)  |Slashing   |1d8 |19|2|  5 ft.|2|
|                   |Piercing   |1d6 |18|4|  5 ft.|2|
|                   |Ranged     |1d8 |19|3| 60 ft.|2|
|3 feet to 5 feet   |Bludgeoning|2d8 |20|3|  5 ft.|2|
|(Long - 1 hand)    |Slashing   |2d8 |19|2|  5 ft.|2|
|                   |Piercing   |2d6 |18|4|  5 ft.|2|
|                   |Ranged     |2d8 |20|4|120 ft.|2|
|Greater than 5 feet|Bludgeoning|3d8 |20|3|  5 ft.|3|
|(Huge - 2 hands)   |Slashing   |2d12|19|2|  5 ft.|3|
|                   |Piercing   |3d6 |18|4|  5 ft.|3|
|                   |Ranged     |2d12|20|4|300 ft.|3|

Second, select the number of weapons modifiers indicated in the base stats table (1 for short weapons, 2 for medium and long, and 3 for huge).

* __[Heavy]__: Increase the damage by one half your level rounding down. You have a -1 penalty on all attack rolls with the weapon. If a Long weapon, it now requires 2 hands to wield.
* __[Light]__: Decrease the damage by one half your level rounding down. You have a +2 bonus on all attack rolls with the weapon.
* __[Deft]__: While wielding this weapon, add +2 to your initiative and a +1 bonus to attack rolls with the weapon.
* __[Devastating]__: Increase the critical multiplier by 1.
* __[Heartseeker]__: Decrease the critical threshold by 1.
* __[Parrying]__: Add +2 to your Armor Class while wielding this weapon.

## Magic Weapons
You may be looking for enchanted weapons, which are located elsewhere. This is for weapons normally associated with magic-users - the basic wands and staves they use, equivalent to a fighter's longsword or a rogue's crossbow.

While magic weapons have much less variety in the implement, they also may select 3 properties, and have their own list of properties. A staff is wielded in two hands (usually one gripping the staff and one gesticulating) - otherwise, it deals damage as a rod.

By default, a magic weapon deals [Force] damage. As magical attacks, they use spell attack rolls and target SR. This means you add your Charisma to damage and your Intelligence to the attack roll.

|Weapon|Base Damage|Crit Thresh|Crit Mult|Range
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Wand |1d8|20|2|30 ft. |
| Rod |2d8|20|2|60 ft. |
|Staff|3d8|20|2|120 ft.|

#### Magic Weapon Properties
* __[Brutal]__: Add one-half your level to the damage, rounding down. If taken twice, add your level to the damage. If taken three times, also increase the damage by 1d8.
* __[Deft]__: While wielding this weapon, add +2 to your initiative.
* __[Devastating]__: Increase the critical multiplier by 1.
* __[Elemental]__: All damage the weapon deals changes from [Force] to one of [Acid], [Cold], [Electricity], or [Fire]. Can only be taken once.
* __[Exciting]__: On a critical hit, apply a condition appropriate to the damage type.
    * [Acid]: [Burning] 1d6 for 3 [Rounds]
    * [Cold]: [Staggered] for 1 [Round]
    * [Electricity]: [Staggered] for 1 [Round]
    * [Fire]: [Burning] 1d6 for 3 [Rounds]
    * [Force]: [Knocked Back] 10 feet.
* __[Heartseeker]__: Decrease the critical threshold by 1.
* __[Precise]__: Attack rolls with this weapon gain a +2 bonus.
* __[Reach]__: Double the range.

## Armor
Armor is any sort of worn equipment to protect yourself against physical harm. Armor is sorted into three categories: light, medium, and heavy. Shields likewise come in the following categories: light, heavy, and tower. In addition, the material of your armor makes a big difference in how much protection it grants and how much mobility you retain.

* _Leather_ armors are made from leather, hide, lamellar, wood, cloth, or other non-metal, reasonably flexible components.
* _Piecemeal_ armors use leather and metal components where each is most appropriate, typically leather over joints and hands with metal over the body.
* _Metal_ armors are made from metal plates and mail. Chain mail, scale mail, and full plate mail are the classic examples.
* _Hybrid_ armors use both leather and metal over the entire body, such as chain maille with a leather gambison underneath. They are realistic and effective.

The exact nature of your armor does not matter - that your light leather armor is actually just layers of quilted cloth or a thick leather cuirass makes no difference. Feel free to add flavor to these armors as you feel appropriate.

__Vulnerability__ is an optional rule for players who want excessive realism. It is recommended that novice players, or players enjoying the high fantasy setting, ignore it. If you enjoy grimdark, consider it.

|Armor|AC Bonus|Move Cost|Vulnerability|
|---|---|---|---|
|  Light Leather   |+2 |0 ft. |5 [Slashing]
| Light Piecemeal  |+3 |0 ft. |
|   Light Metal    |+3 |5 ft. |
|   Light Hybrid   |+4 |0 ft. |
|  Medium Leather  |+5 |0 ft. |2 [Slashing]
| Medium Piecemeal |+6 |0 ft. |2 [Piercing]
|   Medium Metal   |+7 |5 ft. |2 [Bludgeoning]
|  Medium Hybrid   |+8 |5 ft. |
|  Heavy Leather   |+9 |0 ft. |
| Heavy Piecemeal  |+10|5 ft. |5 [Piercing]
|   Heavy Metal    |+11|10 ft.|5 [Bludgeoning]
|   Heavy Hybrid   |+12|10 ft.|

|Shield|AC Bonus|Move Cost|Vulnerability|
|---|---|---|---|
|Light Wood Shield |+1 |0 ft. |5 [Fire]
|Light Metal Shield|+1 |0 ft. |5 [Electricity]
|Heavy Wood Shield |+3 |0 ft. |2 [Fire]
|Heavy Metal Shield|+3 |5 ft. |2 [Electricity]
|Tower Wood Shield |+5 |10 ft.|

## Robes
Robes are the magical equivalent of armor. They are given low-grade enchantments and sewn with small lead discs in them to provide a resistance to magic. In order to power the enchantments, many robes require a small amount of your life energy - this reduces your hit points, but can easily be restored by taking off the robe.

Robes come in three categories - conventionally called white, grey, and black, though the robes can be any color. Each category is designed for progressively stronger mages more able to handle the health costs. Within a category, there are four forms:

* Capes - affixed at the shoulder, hanging about to the knee. Frequently gets caught in things.
* Cloaks - similar to a cape, but more voluminous, able to wrap around the whole body. Comes with a good. Also good against rain.
* Coats - a cloak with sleeves. Less likely to get caught in things. Hangs closer to the body. Not as stylish.
* Robes - an overgarment that wraps around the entire body and can be secured in front. Pretentious and effective.

|Robes|SR Bonus|Base HP Cost|
|---|---|---|
|White Cape |+2 |0|
|White Cloak|+3 |0|
|White Coat |+4 |0|
|White Robes|+5 |1|
| Grey Cape |+6 |0|
|Grey Cloak |+7 |0|
| Grey Coat |+8 |1|
|Grey Robes |+9 |1|
|Black Cape |+10|0|
