# Classes

In Dawnfire RPG, a class is a guided progression through the myriad of feats available. You are not required to have one - see the classless option below. For new players, it is recommended you pick a class and follow it, since it restricts what options you need to look at. Even for experienced players, following a class may give you access to feats you otherwise would not reach, or reach them earlier.

The classes are summarized here, but more details are provided in each class' individual section.

## Fighter
Fighters are powerful melee combatants fueled by totemic powers. They are most effective grinding through hordes of enemies. Fighters can enter specialized mental states to focus their power - be it a blinding rage, peaceful meditation, or steady nihilism.

Totems: 
* __Bear__: The Bear is a spirit of steady, stolid power, knocking aside its foes and shrugging off devastating blows. Its roar turns even the bravest to cowards.
* __Crane__: The Crane is a spirit of peace and evasion, staying out of reach and deflecting enemy attacks. Its inner peace is catching, peacefully ending fights.
* __Dragon__: The Dragon is a dual spirit of wrath and understanding. Its flames burn all, and its presence strikes fear in the bravest. Magic and death dare not touch it.
* __Foundation__: The Foundation is a spirit of rock and stone, able to raise walls, strike enemies through the earth, and hold its own ground.
* __Firmament__: The Firmament is a spirit of the void. Its followers can teleport, channel negative energy and antimagic, holding their foes in inescapable grasp.
* __Serpent__: The Serpent is a spirit of swift precision, striking over and over again, crippling its foes, perfecting its follow-up.
* __Wolf__: The Wolf is a spirit of teamwork, running fast and swift with its allies, flanking enemies and bringing them down.

Fighters put 2 ranks into a combat skills every level, and 3 ranks into any skills they see fit.

## Mage
Powerful wizards with mastery of many spells, mages are the definitive magic-users. They can use their magic in a wide variety of applications, from incapacitating enemies to controlling a battlefield to slipping past foes unnoticed to blatant theft. Mages fall into several schools governing their approach to magic.

Schools:
* __Alchemical__: These mages focus on binding spells to objects, creating potions, wands, staves, and other magical devices.
* __Combat__: These mages focus on combat, studying spells to lay low their enemies and ward themselves from harm and misfortune.
* __Death__: These mages study negative energy and undeath, learning to control the abominations and sap the strength of the living.
* __Life__: These mages study life, learning to heal the sick, ward off undead, and preserve life in all its forms.
* __Time__: These mages focus on combining spells together, casting multiple at once, or one after the other in quick succession.
* __World__: These mages study magic and its interaction with the world. They learn many "utility" spells, such as controlling trees, walking through shadows, and undoing magic.

Mages receive 5 skill ranks each level which they may assign as they see fit.

## Monster
Empowered by a mutagenic plague from an ancient god, Monsters slowly evolve into something bestial, in the pattern of a category of natural monster. They can be effective in any role, from stealth and intrigue to soaking damage and tackling powerful foes.

Aspects:
* __Aberration__: Warped and alien, aberrations gain psychic abilities, can change color, and fly. They are well-suited to intrigue.
* __Animal__: Following a wide variety, animalistic Monsters grow natural weapons, learn to spit webs, become venemous, grow wings, and move quickly.
* __Construct__: Constructs are steady and plodding, resistant to magic, making good defenders.
* __Demon__: Demons are crafty, sneaky, and magically skilled. They are good at twisting others to their purposes.
* __Dragon__: Dragons are everything you would expect: winged reptiles with firey breath, terrifying presence, and paralyzing gaze.
* __Fey__: Enchantingly beautiful, fey are skilled at imposing their will on others, preferring to use poison or tricks in a fight.
* __Undead__: Undead are tough to perish, powerful combatants either physically or magically.

## Rogue
Tinkering tricksters, rogues are the sneak-thiefs and mad scientists that will herald a new age.

* __The Sneakster__: Those who specialize in going unnoticed, slinking past enemies, dodging attacks, and waiting patiently instead of rushing in
* __The Speaker__: Those who specialize in talking to others, swaying their opinions, convincing them to help you, or mesmerizing them with your monologue
* __The Taker__: Those who specialize in taking things, be it pickpocketing keys, disarming enemies, or plucking thoughts from unsuspecting minds

## Unclassed
This progression is for characters without a dedicated class. It requires much greater knowledge of the available feats, and is recommended only for experienced players. If your character concept requires a blend of several of the above classes, this is the right way to proceed.

Unclassed characters receive 5 skill ranks each level which they may assign as they see fit.
